          <h2>Working Groups</h2>

          <p>In order to work in a semi-structured manner, we have created a few working groups
          within Open Data Cape Town. These working groups are tasked with a particular project 
          or topic, and they work on this over a larger timeframe. The working groups are always 
          looking for people to join them, so they are a great way to get involved with Open 
          Data Cape Town.
          </p>

          <div class="alert alert-secondary">
            Please note: because our group has been launched only recently (March 2018), we are 
            in need of people for all of these groups. The good news is that every 'working group' can 
            get started even if there is just one volunteer who gets things started. So don't hesitate
            and reach out if you have an interest in any of the groups -- even if you only want to do 
            a small part of it.
          </div>

          <h3>Group 1: Use Cases</h3>

          <p>This working group is tasked with finding out more about how open data is used in Cape 
          Town. Who is using data, and in what way? What kinds of tools or websites have been built?
          What articles have been published and what research has been undertaken using open data? 
          The goal is to get more insights into the use of open data in our city. By better understanding
          how data is used, we can find out what activities we should engage in, what gaps there are,
          and where our users are working on. 
          </p>

          <p>One of the primary outputs of this working group is the <a href="showcases.html">showcase</a> section.
          The idea is to put all public projects in this showcase section, so that everyone can see examples
          of open data usage. 
          </p>

          <p><strong>Some things that have to be done</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reach out to Cape Town's universities and ask about usage of open data</li>
            <li>Go through newspapers and media websites to find uses of open data</li>
            <li>Reach out to the programming community to find open data websites and tools</li>
            <li>Identify the most interesting projects and do a small writeup about these projects</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="improvements">Group 2: Open Data Portal Improvements</h3>

          <p>Many of us have used <a href="https://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/OpenDataPortal/">Cape Town's Open Data Portal</a>,
          and felt that some things could be improved. The Open Data portal at the city is a good start, but
          there are a lot of components to be improved. From ways to navigate the site to the underlying data
          structures and data availability.
          </p>

          <p>The goal of this group is to better understand what kinds of improvements to the Open Data
          Portal users want. All users are invited to share their ideas, suggestions, and complaints. 
          This can be done through our <a href="join.html">mailing list</a> or by <a href="contact.html">contacting us</a>.
          This working group will compile an overview of the most commonly heard suggestions and 
          draft a letter from the user group to the City of Cape Town, to express these ideas and
          suggestions.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Some things that have to be done</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reach out to users to ask for their comments and ideas.</li>
            <li>Profile of some of the most interesting ones in our announcements, to trigger a debate on the topic.</li>
            <li>Perform an analysis of the complaints and comments.</li>
            <li>Write an official letter to the City.</li>
            <li>Engage in a constructive discussion with the City around the issues that were raised.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><a href="contact.html" class="button">Contact us</a> to sign up for this group</p>
          
          <h3>Group 3: Communications and Outreach</h3>

          <p>As a user group we need to get the word out. We need to tell people about our group, but we also
          need to tell people about open data in general, and how they can use this in Cape Town. Furthermore, 
          our group should create partnerships and collaborations with other groups that are working in the same
          field. This group is in charge of communications and outreach with all these other people.</p>

          <p><strong>Some things that have to be done</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify possible users of open data and make sure they know about our group.</li>
            <li>Write news and announcements about Open Data Cape Town, and distribute this in different places.</li>
            <li>Maintain different communication channels (website, social media, etc.)</li>
            <li>Set up partnerships with relevant other organisations.</li>
            <li>Ensure we reach a diverse audience in our communications.</li>
          </ul>
